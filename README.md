# Fall-2024-Challenge

TECH STUFF FOR FALL 2024 CHALLENGE:

Next Steps:

- Fix UI (would like to use Gradio --> the upload file isn't working)
- Our backup is Streamlit (ask GPT how to make loading times faster/more user-friendly)

Friday Meeting:

- Showcase Streamlit (both functions with file and link upload)
- Showcase Gradio UI
- Which UI? (vote)
- Prompt Engineering with entire team

Sunday Meeting
- prompt engineering
- feed code the training data we were creating
- add Notebook LLM feature
- fix file upload part on Gradio UI
- make UI nicer? (waiting on wireframe)
- RAG pipeline? make it more conversational

Future:

- More features (possibly use Notebook LLM? Podcasts, flowcharts?)
- Gather training data from GPT (the pdf, script and links)
- Test prototype with training data we made
- Test prototype with fake urls or spelling errors, also inputting incorrect file types
- Technical diagram?

*Note*
- Another tech meetup this Sunday
