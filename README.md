Saturday Meeting:

- Check to see if link upload feature works on Streamlit
- Does our solution use GenAI (I know for Q&A and summarization it does, but what about the audio and flowchart features since I didn't use Notebook LLM) --> Ask GPT to help us convert those to use GenAI
- Are we still doing prompt engineering? (Ask GPT for help)
- Decide on Demo Training material so can record demo in evening
- Maybe start in slides?
- Dhruv mentioned an architecture diagram?

Sunday Meeting
- Slides, script and Q&A
